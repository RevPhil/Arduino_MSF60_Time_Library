 MsfTimeLib Version 2.6.0 SUITABLE FOR THE ESP8266 WIFI MODULE

 A class to decode the MSF Time Signal from Anthorn, Cumbria, UK
 Inspired by Richard Jarkman's original MSFTime library but with a different
 approach. The makeTime() function is borrowed from the Time library by Michael Margolis
 You are free to use this library as you see fit as long as this text remains with it!

 /* TIME DATA AVAILABLE AT THE START OF THE NEW MINUTE */
 
 The variables available to the user are:

 uint8_t TimeAvailable		// set when time and date data has been decoded successfully
							// at the exact start of the 500 ms START pulse so, if
							// "timeAvailable" is "true", set the RTC or Time library "NOW"
 uint8_t TimeReceived		// set during the final 500ms of the current minute
 uint8_t ParityResult		// the result of the Parity check (see below)
 uint8_t Bst				// 1 = BST, 0 = GMT
 uint8_t BstSoon			// 1 = BST imminent
 uint16_t DutPos		    // DUT1 Positive value in ms
 uint16_t DutNeg		    // DUT1 Negative value in ms
 uint8_t NumSeconds		 	// the current number of seconds received
 int8_t LeapSecond		 	// normally "0" but will change to either "-1" or "1" if a leap
							// second is deducted/added
 unit8_t rtcBuffer[7)		// Buffer containing the time values for setting an RTC in BCD*
 time_t TimeTime		 	// a Time library time_t compatible for Time/RTC library use
 
 * the rtc buffer is filled in this order which is the DS1307 & DS3231 format:
 
 rtcBuffer[0] = 0
 rtcBuffer[1] = Minute
 rtcBuffer[2] = Hour
 rtcBuffer[3] = Day
 rtcBuffer[4] = Date
 rtcBuffer[5] = Month
 rtcBuffer[6] = Year (two digits)
 
 // FUNCTIONS
 uint8_t msf.bcdToDec(uint8_t _bcd) 	//is provided to convert the rtcBuffer values to Decimal numbers
 uint32_t msf.freeMem()					// returns a long containing the amount of free DRAM memory
 
// MACROS
 // a simple replacement for multiple Serial,print statements to add a "0" before a number
 // x = number, y = comparison value. For use with BCD Bytes use y = 10. For straight HEX
 // Bytes use y = 16 to split the Byte.
 
 MSF_PRINT(x,y) Serial.print(x<y?"0":"");\Serial.print(x,HEX);
 
 Example: MSF_PRINT(9,10);	// prints "09" as 9 (x) is less than 10 (y)

 // does the same as MSF_PRINT for the Streaming library.
 MSF_PRINTS(x,y) (x<y?"0":"") << _HEX(x)
 
 Example: Serial << MSF_PRINTS(9,10);	// prints "09" as 9 (x) is less than 10 (y)

 /* STARTING/CONFIGURING THE LIBRARY */

 MSF_PAD_5MS				// add 5 ms to the input pulses
 MSF_PAD_10MS				// add 10 ms to the input pulses
 MSF_PAD_15MS				// add 15 ms to the input pulses
 MSF_PAD_20MS				// add 20 ms to the input pulses
 MSF_PAD_25MS				// add 25 ms to the input pulses

Example: uint8_t = msf.bcdToDec(msf.rtcBuffer[MSF_DATE]); 	// provides the decimal value
															// of the date Byte of the rtcBuffer
 
 Constants available for information (after the "begin" statement):
 
 MSF_BOARD_TYPE				// returns the Arduino board type e.g. "UNO"
 MSF_AVR_TYPE				// returns a string of the AVR type if defined e.g. "ATmega328(P)"
 MSF_INT_PINS				// returns the number of interrupt pins on the sefined AVR device
 
 The library is pre-configured as "msf" but you can create your own instance if you like:
 
 MsfTimeLib myMsf;
 
 AVR interrupt pin assignments:
 
 Board			int.0	int.1	int.2	int.3	int.4	int.5
 Uno, Ethernet	2		3	 	 	 	 
 Mega2560		2		3		21		20		19		18
 ATmega1284		10		11		3
 
 ESP8266 interrupt number = GPIOx pin number (except GPIO16).

 To start MsfTimeLib:
 
 uint8_t =  begin(Interrupt Number, Padding Time, MSF Polarity, PON Pin, LED Pin);
 
 The default values are <MSF Polarity> = HIGH, <PON Pin> = 0, <LED Pin> = 0
 
 msf.begin(uint8_t _intNum, int8_t _padding);
 msf.begin(uint8_t _intNum, int8_t _padding, uint8_t _carrierOff);
 msf.begin(uint8_t _intNum, int8_t _padding, uint8_t _carrierOff, uint8_t _ponPin);
 msf.begin(uint8_t _intNum, int8_t _padding, uint8_t _carrierOff, uint8_t _ponPin, uint8_t _ledPin);

 <Interrupt Number>:	// The default interrupt number as assigned by the variant file for
						// The AVR or board. See table above
 <Padding Time>			// The number of milli seconds to add to the incoming pulse if pulses are too short
 <MSF Polarity>			// The level of the Carrier OFF signal from the MSF receiver, HIGH or LOW, can be
						// MSF_PULSE_LOW or MSF_PULSE_HIGH
 <PON Pin>				// <optional> a pin that can be used to turn the MSF receiver ON/OFF
						// The default is ON (LOW)
 <LED Pin>				// <optional> a pin that can be attached to a LED (with resistor) to show the MSF pulses

 Padding:

 The library requires that MSF pulses are not less tham 100ms, 200ms, 300ms and 500ms
 In the unlikely event that your MSF receiver outputs pulses that are SHORTER than the required
 pulses, you can add padding in ms to make up the shortfall. The symptoms of "short" pulses is
 dropped seconds even when the signal is perfect.
 
 Padding Time definitions:

 MSF_PAD_0MS
 MSF_PAD_5MS
 MSF_PAD_10MS
 MSF_PAD_15MS
 MSF_PAD_20MS
 MSF_PAD_25MS
 MSF_PAD_30MS

 uint8_t begin() returns the digital pin number that the interrupt is assigned to or 0 if all is not well.
 
 0 will be returned if the interrupt number is invalid for the AVR type. For instance, trying to
 use interrupt number 16 on an ESP8266 device will return 0 as that interrupt does not exist.
 Upon successful starting of the library the following data is also available:
 
 MSF_BOARD_TYPE		// example value "UNO/NANO/PRO MINI"
 MSF_AVR_TYPE		// example value "ATmega8/48/88/168/328(P)" (AVR family)
 MSF_INT_PINS		// example value 2 (number of interrupt pins)

 Use msf.RxON(uint8_t); to switch the receiver ON/OFF, LOW = ON, HIGH = OFF, the default is LOW
 
 Use uint8_t = msf.RxIsOn() to return the current state of the PON Pin.

 To detect when valid time is available use the msf.TimeAvailable flag which is set within a few microseconds
 of the start of the new minute which is when you synchronise the time:

	if(msf.TimeAvailable)
	{
		/* your code goes here */
		msf.TimeAvailable = 0;	// YOU MUST CLEAR THE FLAG
	}
	
 PLEASE NOTE: As the correct time from the MSF transmitter is only available at the start
 of the new minute it is not possible to use the setSyncProvider() function of the Time library
 TimeTime is provided for manual setting of the Time library using the setTime(time_t) function like this:

 For the Time library:
 
 	if(msf.TimeAvailable)
	{
		setTime(msf.TimeTime);
		msf.TimeAvailable = 0;	// YOU MUST CLEAR THE FLAG
	}
	
 or for a RTC device using the Wire library:
 
 	if(msf.TimeAvailable)
	{
		Wire.beginTransmission(<RTC I2C address>);
		Wire.write(0);	// the first (seconds) register
		for(uint8_t x;x<7;x++)
		{
			Wire.write(msf.rtcBuffer[x]);
		}
		Wire.endTransmission();
		msf.TimeAvailable = 0;	// YOU MUST CLEAR THE FLAG
	}

 IF msf.TimeAvailable IS NOT SEEN use msf.TimeReceived to aid DEBUGGING//
 
 msf.TimeReceived is also available as a warning that the time will change. It is set to "1"
 during the final 500ms of the minute if the end of frame marker has been received. Parity is also checked
 so you can see why TimeAvailable is not being set:
 
 if(msf.TimeReceived) Serial.println(msf.ParityResult);
 
 msf.ParityReult values:
 
 0	Parity Good, no problems
 1	Year Data Parity Error
 2	Month Data Parity Error
 3	Weekday Parity Error
 4	Time Data Parity Error

 /* CONSIDERATIONS */
 
 The MSF signal is NOT guaranteed to be available 24/7/365. Official planned outages are detailed on the
 National Physical Laboratory website at:
 
 http://www.npl.co.uk/science-technology/time-frequency/products-and-services/time/msf-outages
 
 In addition to the planned outages faults can occur which means that MSF time should never be relied upon
 as the sole time source. Common practice makes use of a RTC (Real Time Clock) module which would be used
 as the actual time source. The RTC would be sysnchronised with the MSF time at regular intervals.
 
 I DO NOT recommend the DS1307 RTC device as it is far too inaccurate. The best device is the DS3231 RTC.
 
 During planned outages, which normally take place during daylight hours, the MSF transmitter may still output
 a carrier which will almost certainly be interrupted by either random pulses or interference. It is possible
 that enough pulses may be detected and decoded by the MSF receiver and the MsfTimeLib library to provide
 valid time data BUT this time data will almost certainly be incorrect e.g. the wrong time and or date can be
 decoded! It has been known for the MSF station to transmit incorrect time and date information during outages.
 
 It is therefore not a good idea to try and synchronise the RTC with MSF time during daylight hours. I suggest
 scheduling synchronisation to begin at 01:00 hours (the time being taken from the RTC). The MSF time can then
 be sampled every minute until a valid time has been received and the RTC has been synchronised.
 
 The msf.BstSoon flag should be set at 01:59 on the applicable morning and it will remain in force for 61 minutes
 until 02:00 when the msf.Bst flag will either be set true or rest to false.
 
 If msf.BstSoon is true, BST (British Sumer Time) is due at 02:00 so, prepare to synchronise again at 02:00
 when BST takes effect. At 02:00 start the MSF/RTC synchronisation again until msf.Bst is true or, if BST
 is ending until msf.Bst is false. BST starts at 02:00 on the morning of the last Sunday in March and ends
 at 02:00 on the morning of the last Sunday in October.
